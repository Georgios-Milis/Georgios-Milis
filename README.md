### Hi, I'm George ðŸ‘‹

I am an incoming PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park. My main interests are image, speech, and language processing. I recently graduated from the National Technical University of Athens, where I specialized in Signal Processing, Robotics, and Electronics. I am conducting research in the area of audiovisual speech and recently released NEUTART, a photorealistic text-driven talking face generator with realistic lip articulation.
